## About Me:
I am currently a Computer Science student at Heartland Community College in Normal Illinois with the intent to transfer to a 4 year university and pursue a degree in Cyber Security. As a non traditional student I have had the pleasure of experiencing a career in IT before attending college. Over my career I have worked in many different organizations such as government/military, startup, corporate and currently in education at the college I also attend. Along the way I have worked with several technologies from Salesforce to Virtulisation products to working with the commandline in Linux operating systems. Aside from my enthusiatic technological pursuits I love art and like to spend whatever free time I have creating new digital art pieces. I have also worked part time as a cook over the years and I love to try new recipes from various cultures.
