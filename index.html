<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>I am currently a Computer Science student at Heartland Community College in Normal Illinois with the intent 
  to transfer to a 4 year university and pursue a degree in Cyber Security. As a non traditional student I have 
  had the pleasure of experiencing a career in IT before attending college. Over my career I have worked in many 
  different organizations such as government/military, startup, corporate and currently in education. Along the way 
  I have worked with several technologies from Salesforce to Virtulisation products to working in the commandline in 
  Linux operating systems. Aside from my enthusiatic technological pursuits I love art, cooking, music, and philosophy. </p>
