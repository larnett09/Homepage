<p><b>Hey there, I'm Levi! Welcome to my personal site!</b></p> 
  I am currently a Computer Science student pursuing a degree in Cyber Security. I am a non traditional student and have 
  had the pleasure of experiencing a career in IT before attending college. Over my career I have worked in many 
  different organizations such as government/military, startup, corporate and currently in education. I am very passionate about
  all things computers, and especially enjoy using Linux systems. Linux has put the fun and creativity in computers for me. 
  Aside from my enthusiatic technological pursuits I love art, cooking, music, and philosophy. </p>
