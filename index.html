      <p>I am currently a full time student pursuing a degree in Creative Technologies with an emphasis in Game Design. I currently enjoy doing level design. </p>
      <p>I am a non traditional student and have had the experience of a career in IT before attending college. Throughout my career I have worked in many diverse organizations such as government/military, startup, corporate and currently in education. I am very passionate about all things computing, and especially enjoy using open source systems. Aside from my enthusiastic technological pursuits I love art, cooking, gaming, music, and philosophy. </p>
